            <h2>Investment Risk Acknowledgment</h2>
            <p>
                Investing in cryptocurrencies and digital assets involves significant risk. By using WolvCapital, 
                you acknowledge and accept the following:
            </p>

            <h3>Market Volatility</h3>
            <p>
                Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile. Prices may fluctuate rapidly, resulting in potential gains 
                or losses. The value of your investment may increase or decrease significantly over short periods of time.
            </p>

            <h3>Regulatory Uncertainty</h3>
            <p>
                The legal and regulatory framework for digital assets is evolving. Changes in laws or enforcement may 
                impact platform operations or user access. We strive to maintain compliance with all applicable regulations, 
                but cannot guarantee immunity from regulatory changes.
            </p>

            <h3>Security Risks</h3>
            <p>
                While WolvCapital employs advanced security measures and manual transaction reviews, no system is immune 
                to cyber threats or operational disruptions. We implement industry-standard security protocols, but users 
                must also maintain proper account security practices.
            </p>

            <h3>Liquidity Risk</h3>
            <p>
                Certain assets or investment plans may have limited liquidity, affecting your ability to withdraw or 
                transfer funds promptly. All withdrawal requests are subject to manual approval processes which may result 
                in processing delays.
            </p>

            <h3>Operational Risk</h3>
            <p>
                Our manual approval process, while designed for security, may result in processing delays. Platform 
                outages, technical failures, or human error could affect your ability to access your account or execute 
                transactions.
            </p>

            <h2>Manual Approval Process</h2>
            <p>
                All transactions require manual review and approval, which means:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Processing delays of 24-72 hours are normal</li>
                <li>Transactions may be rejected based on compliance or risk assessment</li>
                <li>Emergency withdrawals may not be immediately available</li>
                <li>Processing times may increase during high volume periods or security reviews</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Investment Disclaimers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>No investment returns are guaranteed</li>
                <li>Past performance does not indicate future results</li>

                choices and associated risks. You acknowledge that:
