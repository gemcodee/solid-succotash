            <h2>General Investment Risks</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>ALL INVESTMENTS INVOLVE RISK OF LOSS.</strong> The value of investments can go down as well as up, 
                and you may receive back less than your original investment. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
            </p>

            <h2>Specific Risks</h2>
            
            <h3>Market Risk</h3>
            <p>
                Investment values may fluctuate due to market conditions, economic factors, political events, 
                and other external circumstances beyond our control.
            </p>

            <h3>Liquidity Risk</h3>
            <p>
                Investments may not be easily convertible to cash, and withdrawal requests are subject to 
                manual approval processes which may result in delays.
            </p>

            <h3>Operational Risk</h3>
            <p>
                Our manual approval process, while designed for security, may result in processing delays 
                and potential human error in transaction handling.
            </p>

            <h3>Technology Risk</h3>
            <p>
                Platform outages, security breaches, or technical failures could affect your ability to 
                access your account or execute transactions.
            </p>

            <h3>Regulatory Risk</h3>
            <p>
                Changes in laws or regulations may affect the operation of the platform and your investments.
            </p>

            <h2>Manual Approval Process Risks</h2>
            <p>
                All transactions require manual approval, which means:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Processing delays of 24-72 hours are normal</li>
                <li>Transactions may be rejected for various reasons</li>
                <li>Emergency withdrawals may not be possible</li>
                <li>Processing times may vary during high volume periods</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Important Disclaimers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>No investment returns are guaranteed</li>
                <li>Daily returns may vary based on market conditions</li>
                <li>Investment plans may be modified or discontinued</li>
                <li>Minimum and maximum investment amounts may change</li>
                <li>Platform fees may apply to certain transactions</li>
            </ul>
